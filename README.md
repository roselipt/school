My goal here is to repeat two homework assignments using gitpod.io.
The first assigments from both my Data Structures and Paradigms in C++ classes both asked for demonstration of the ability to open and read a file.
My goals for repeating these programs are:
1. Better understanding of the try/catch structure in C++
2. Practice with file reading, including passing the open file as handle
3. Practice with a github repository: \nDoes it make sense for instance to include the two new programs along with their originals? \nAre repositories intended for use more like directories or programs? \nHow does version control and maintaining a record of changes work?
